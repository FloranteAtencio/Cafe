Cafe Database
Initial set up for docker and oracle 23c free database version of oracle

--- Introduction ----------

Oracle 23c Structure

Oracle Database 23c:

Instance: The instance is the set of memory structures and background processes that manage the database files.

Container Database (CDB):

CDB: The CDB includes the root container (CDB$ROOT) and one or more Pluggable Databases (PDBs).

Pluggable Database (PDB):

PDB: Acts as an independent database within the CDB. Each PDB has its own users, schemas, and objects. PDBs share the instanceâ€™s memory and processes but are otherwise isolated from one another.

Schema:

Schema: A logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.) under a single user within a PDB. Each user owns their own schema and objects.
So, within your Oracle 23c setup:

One instance manages one CDB.

The CDB contains multiple PDBs.

Each PDB is a self-contained database with its own schemas and objects.

Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS for Database and docker for container.

==== Coder start here in Linux ========

-- Update server

sudo apt update

-- Install docker

sudo apt install docker.io

-- Create Volume for progress
sudo docker volume create oracle_volume

-- Download oracle inside docker this about worth 10 Gb of

sudo docker run -itd --name LegendOfZelda -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PWD='1234' -v oracle_volume:/opt/oracle/oradata container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest

-- Execute sql

sudo docker exec -it LegendOfZelda bash

-- make Directory for  Pluggable and Script
mkdir pluggable
mkdir script
mkdir backup

-- Login as admin 
-- For safer way sqlplus sys@locahost:1521 as sysdba
sqlplus sys/1234@localhost:1521 as sysdba

-- PLUGGABLE DATABASE
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE Dev_Cafe admin user Links IDENTIFIED BY zelda
create_file_dest='/home/oracle/pluggable';

-- Set permision
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE Dev_Cafe OPEN;
EXIT

-- Log in to the database
-- For safer way sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/Dev_Cafe as sysdba
sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/Dev_Cafe as sysdba

-- Grant access to Link
GRANT DBA to Links
GRANT SYSDBA to Links

-- Developer Acess

CREATE ROLE dev_ROLE;

GRANT CONNECT, CREATE SESSION, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TRIGGER, CREATE SYNONYM TO dev_ROLE;

CREATE USER Dev_Hyrule IDENTIFIED BY dev_Password;

GRANT dev_ROLE TO Dev_Hyrule;

GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO Dev_Hyrule;

-- Production Access after the schema is created

CREATE ROLE prod_ROLE;

BEGIN
  FOR t IN (SELECT table_name FROM all_tables WHERE owner = 'Dev_cafe') LOOP
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON ' || 'Dev_cafe' || t.table_name || ' TO prod_ROLE';
  END LOOP;
END;

CREATE USER Prod IDENTIFIED BY ProdPassword

GRANT prod_ROLE TO Prod

EXIT

--  DBA As link
-- safe way sqlplus Link@localhost:1521/Dev_Cafe
sqlplus Links/zelda@localhost:1521/Dev_Cafe
-- or
