# Cafe
Cafe Database
Initial set up for docker and oracle 23c free database version of oracle

--- Introduction ----------

Oracle 23c Structure

Oracle Database 23c:

Instance: The instance is the set of memory structures and background processes that manage the database files.

Container Database (CDB):

CDB: The CDB includes the root container (CDB$ROOT) and one or more Pluggable Databases (PDBs).

Pluggable Database (PDB):

PDB: Acts as an independent database within the CDB. Each PDB has its own users, schemas, and objects. PDBs share the instanceâ€™s memory and processes but are otherwise isolated from one another.

Schema:

Schema: A logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.) under a single user within a PDB. Each user owns their own schema and objects.
So, within your Oracle 23c setup:

One instance manages one CDB.

The CDB contains multiple PDBs.

Each PDB is a self-contained database with its own schemas and objects.

Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS for Database and docker for container.

==== Coder start here in Linux ========

-- Update server

sudo apt update

-- Install docker

sudo apt install docker.io

-- Download oracle inside docker

sudo docker run -itd --name LegendOfZelda \
-e ORACLE_PWD='p1a2s0s3word' \
-p 1521:1521 \
-v /home/oracle : /opt/oracle/oradata \
container-registry.oracle.com/database/free:latest

-- Execute sql

sudo docker exec -it LegendOfZelda bash

-- Login as admin 
-- For safer way sqlplus sys@locahost:1521 as sysdba

-- PLUGGABLE DATABASE
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE Dev_Cafe admin user Links IDENTIFIED BY zelda \
create_file_dest='/home/oracle';

-- Set permision
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE Dev_Cafe OPEN;
EXIT

-- Log in to the database
-- For safer way sqlplus sys@localhost:1521/Dev_cafe as sysdba

-- Grant access to Link
GRANT DBA to link CONTAINER = ALL

-- Developer Acess

CREATE ROLE dev_ROLE;

      CREATE SEQUENCE, CREATE TRIGGER, CREATE SYNONYM TO dev_ROLE;

CREATE USER Dev_Hyrule IDENTIFIED BY dev_Password

GRANT dev_ROLE TO Dev;

GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO Dev;

-- Production Access after the schema is created

CREATE ROLE prod_ROLE;

BEGIN
