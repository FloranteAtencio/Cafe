Cafe Database
Initial set up for docker and oracle 23c free database version of oracle

--- Introduction ----------

Oracle 23c Structure

Oracle Database 23c:

Instance: The instance is the set of memory structures and background processes that manage the database files.

Container Database (CDB):

CDB: The CDB includes the root container (CDB$ROOT) and one or more Pluggable Databases (PDBs).

Pluggable Database (PDB):

PDB: Acts as an independent database within the CDB. Each PDB has its own users, schemas, and objects. PDBs share the instanceâ€™s memory and processes but are otherwise isolated from one another.

Schema:

Schema: A logical grouping of database objects (tables, views, indexes, etc.) under a single user within a PDB. Each user owns their own schema and objects.
So, within your Oracle 23c setup:

One instance manages one CDB.

The CDB contains multiple PDBs.

Each PDB is a self-contained database with its own schemas and objects.

Ubuntu Server 24.04.1 LTS for Database and docker for container.
